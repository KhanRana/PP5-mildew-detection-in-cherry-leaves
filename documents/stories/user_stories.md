a. Train the model with images ratio (train:test:validate) 70:20:10
b. Optimise the model to get 97% accuracy
c. Validate the model by using new images

## 4 - Dashboard planning, designing, and development

As a user, I can see a dashboard so that I can see a summary, healthy and affected leaves, download images and report, and hypothesis and technical report

### Acceptance Criteria
a. Summary, hypothesis, and technical report pages present
b. A page listing your findings related to a study to visually differentiate a cherry leaf that is healthy from one that contains powdery mildew
c. A page containing:
(A link to download a set of cherry leaf images for live prediction. A User Interface with a file uploader widget. The user should have the capacity to upload multiple images. For each image, it will display the image and a prediction statement, indicating if a cherry leaf is healthy or contains powdery mildew and the probability associated with this statement; A table with the image name and prediction results, and a download button to download the table).

### Tasks
a. Create a summary, hypothesis, and technical report page
b. Image montage page showing the findings visually
c. Create a link to the data repository for live prediction and download results, and the probability of mildew of healthy leave
